./nse-linux386 <host> <host_port>

Secondly, run the five routers in order from 1 to 5
./router 1 <host> <nse_port> <router_port>
./router 2 <host> <nse_port> <router_port>
./router 3 <host> <nse_port> <router_port>
./router 4 <host> <nse_port> <router_port>
./router 5 <host> <nse_port> <router_port>
